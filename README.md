Hey there! I'm Ravi Vishnu Dasari 👋

I'm a recent Computer Science graduate and an enthusiastic tech explorer who loves building things and learning continuously.

About Me:

I'm deeply passionate about technology, especially in these areas:
Cloud Computing ☁️
AI Engineering, Machine Learning, and Generative AI 🤖
Backend Development – I started off as a Node.js developer and have hands-on experience with MySQL and PostgreSQL. These days, I'm diving even deeper into database design and advanced backend systems.
I’m also very interested in Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) and Platform Engineering – attending workshops, learning how to build scalable and reliable infrastructure is something I truly enjoy.

Tech Stack:
Programming Languages: JavaScript (Node.js), SQL
Databases: MySQL, PostgreSQL
Cloud Knowledge: Basics of AWS and cloud-native concepts
AI/ML: Exploring Python-based tools, generative models, and practical applications
Other Tools: Git, Postman, Docker (learning phase), and a growing interest in DevOps and observability tools
My Goals for 2025:
Build full-fledged AI-powered backend systems
Get certified in Cloud and DevOps fundamentals
Start contributing to open-source platform engineering projects
Share what I learn through blogs and videos to help others
